This project has helped me work on making code that is reusable and also helped me work on my planning. These tactics will help me in the future to have a solid plan when I start working on a project.
I used iteration for this project by working on small parts of it each week until the project was completed.
My approach to developing changed because I got more thoughtful about how I looked at my project and what steps it would take to complete it.
Learning graphics and visualization made me a better learner when it comes to software developement that can be used in both future classes and professions so that I can learn quickly and on the fly.
